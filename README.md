# Velociraptor Artifacts

Welcome to my personal GitHub page where I share my Velociraptor VQL artifacts!

As a digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) professional, I have been using Velociraptor to perform investigations and gather valuable insights. On this page, I share my collection of Velociraptor VQL artifacts with you.

Velociraptor is an open-source endpoint monitoring, digital forensics, and incident response tool that uses a powerful query language called VQL (Velociraptor Query Language). It allows users to easily write and execute custom queries against their endpoints to gather valuable information and perform investigations.

Here, you will find a wide variety of VQL artifacts related to Velociraptor. These artifacts include queries that I have developed and used in real-world investigations, as well as scripts and tools that I have created to help automate certain tasks.

I hope that my collection of Velociraptor artifacts will be useful to other DFIR professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts. Feel free to use and modify these artifacts as needed, and please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
